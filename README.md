## jMonkeyEngine

* Installation: https://wiki.jmonkeyengine.org/docs/documentation.html#install
  * Recommended: run `download-dependencies.sh` to automatically download and uncompress the dependencies. After that, always run javac/java with `-classpath "dependencies/jME3.3.2-stable/lib/*:dependencies/algs4.jar:."`
    ...Or just point your favorite IDE to the appropriate JAR and java source files.
  * Note: Windows users should use a semicolon (`;`) instead of a colon (`:`).
